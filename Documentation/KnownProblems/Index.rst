Known Problems
==============

Currently Open Street Map is not fully implemented. You can create Point, Area, Route and Radius Markers and you can
assign them individual icons, sizes and categories, but they are not possible for City- and Street-Search Plugin.
Further you can not automatically create PoiCollection records while saving foreign location records with OpenStreetMap
